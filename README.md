This repository contains a custom container node made for Godot.<br />
<br />
"ui_container" is derived from the Node2D class and functions<br />
similarly to how VBoxContainers sort Control nodes around.<br />
<br />
This container node aims to improve the functionality and flexibility<br />
 of how containers work in the Godot engine.<br />
<br />
Making it easier to organize and layout UI elements.<br />
<br />
"ui_element" node is added to put inside of the new container node.<br />

### TODO
* Sort ui_elements in a few ways
